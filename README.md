# Kaspersky Password Manager - Proton Pass
A simple python tool to help you switch to Proton Pass from Kaspersky Password Manager.
You can simply put your exported txt file from Kaspersky Password Manager and put it in the folder as "kaspersky.txt".
Then run the tool, which will generate a generic-proton.csv file with your passwords.

Once you're done running the tool, upload the generic-proton.csv to Proton Pass and you're done!
